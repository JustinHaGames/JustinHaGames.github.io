	I've always wanted to make something that people find beautiful. Every time I feel close to achieving this, I discover something that can make it even better and I dive head first into learning everything about it.

	The games I make revolve around complex emotions. Currently working on <i> better</i>, my thesis game about wanting to be as good as someone else.
