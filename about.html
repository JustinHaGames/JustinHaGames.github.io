	What the heck is a <b>Justin Ha</b>?
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	Justin wanted to be a tennis player, singer, writer, and architect growing up, but he spent all his time playing games. He doesn't regret it all.
	<br>
	<br>
	He made his own Yu-Gi-Oh expansion set when he was 9 years old, and some of the cards are laminated back at his home in Texas. When he got older, his parents told him to stop playing games and try studying harder. So he tried his best to quietly play League of Legends on the family computer at 3 AM. He was caught many times.
	<br>
	<br>
	When it was finally time to apply to colleges, he initially put down that he was going to major in Communications. Then he realized that he had no idea what a Communication major does. He scrolled down a list of career paths and came across Game Design. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Would his parents approve of this choice?
	<br>
	<br>
	Could he make it as a Game Designer?
	<br>
	<br>
	To his surprise, his parents thought that if they could never stop him from playing games, then he would probably be great at it.
	<br>
	<br>
	Since then, his family keeps track of the mechanics he has worked on, he's worked with many developers that he would call family, and he's always excited for the next release day.
