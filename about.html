	<b>Justin Ha's</b> Game Design goal is to create characters and mechanics that will make a player say "This was made for me."
	<br>
	<br>
	He recieved his BFA in Game Design from the NYU Game Center at New York University where he focused on creating games with beautiful emotional experiences and unique competitive systems. Now he spends his free time talking with other Game Design students to help give them the advice he wished he got when he started.
	<br>
	<br>
	Justin works towards not only improving himself, but also the culture he's a part of. Other than designing characters worthy of their own reveal trailers, Justin's dream is to make deep connections with the talented team around him and help make their worlds an exciting place.
