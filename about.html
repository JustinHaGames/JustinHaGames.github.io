	I've always wanted to make games that people find deep and beautiful. Every time I feel close to achieving this, I discover something that can make it even better and I dive head first into learning everything about it.
	<br>
	<br>
	In my free time I'm making small prototypes that revolve around abstract stories, debating competitive game patches with friends, or going crazy about a new thing I've become extremely interested in. (Lately it's been building mechanical keyboards)
