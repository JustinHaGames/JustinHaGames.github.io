	<br>
	In the summer of 2018, I had the priviledge of working for Move38 as a game design intern! I quickly learned how to design/code games on Blinks, digital game pieces made with Arduino.
	<br>
	<br>
	During my time at Move38, I got to get a taste of the startup life. I got my hands involved with a lot of different departments such as product design, packaging design, quality assurance testing, advertising, community outreach, and showing off Blinks at public events!
	<br>
	<br>
	To learn more about Blinks and one of the official games I co-designed, look at the link/video below!
