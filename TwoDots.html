	<b>Two Dots</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	<em>Two Dots</em> is an award winning puzzle mobile game with millions of players around the world! Players connect dots and interact with over 50 mechanics to solve puzzles and progress through new worlds.
	<br>
	<br>
	As a Game Designer at Dots, I've made over 1000 levels, lead the development team for mechanics I pitched, communicated with Product team to help make new features, created a new feature for our new game <em>Garden Tails</em>, made sure live events are running smoothly, and much more!

	<b>Pinecones</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Wrote out the full spec for Pinecones and helped ideate its metaphor.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Goal: The <em>Two Dots</em> team wanted to create 3 new mechanics that would be AB tested to see if they would improve the FTUE.</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	For any game, the First Time User Experience determines if a player will commit to a game or not. <em>Two Dots</em> is an 8 year old game and we were looking for ways to improve the FTUE. With a better understanding of our players, we ideated mechanics that would work well with the game's linker gameplay and be beginner friendly.
	<br>
	<br>
	I was in charge of writing the design spec for Pinecones, testing Pinecones with every single mechanic, and overseeing Pinecones throughout the development process.

<b>Coconuts</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Was the primary Game Designer who lead the development team to create Coconuts! From pitch to release!
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Goal: I wanted to create a new obstacle that challenged the players in a different way.</b>
	<br>
	<br>
</p>

	Coconuts fall under the same archetype of blocker mechanics as Fire Dots, Vines, and Slime. However, Coconuts spread in a much different way that changes how players approach Coconuts.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Fire Dots:</b> will burn any other Dots around them if they are not hit with an adjacent connection. If any Fire Dots are hit on the screen, none of them will spread.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Vines:</b> will spread and cover a single Dot around them. Groups of Vines spread individually, so hitting one group of Vines won't stop the other from spreading.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Slime:</b> spreads underneath Dots and can be cleared if they are hit twice. If any Slime on the board is hit, none of it will spread.
	<br>
	<br>
	The difference between Coconuts and these mechanics is that Coconuts do not spread infinitely. If the other mechanics are not dealt with, it's possible for players to reach a point where there is so much Fire/Vine/Slime that they might as well give up.
	<br>
	<br>
	To mitigate this, Coconuts will always split into halves, and then quarters when they are hit. So each Coconut will only take over 4 spaces on the gameboard, and there's a limit to how many Coconuts and Coconut pieces can be on the board so they will never spread infinitely.
	<br>
	<br>
	However, the unique challenge of Coconuts is that the way they spread is unpredictable. When a Coconut splits, they will replace a random Classic Dot on the gameboard which can mess with a player's plans. While randomness feels a bit unfair to players, another beauty of Coconuts is that they will only bite when you mess with them. While I was playtesting Coconuts, it felt interesting to have a threat that you can choose to deal with later. This was an interaction that did not exist within <em>Two Dots</em> yet.

<b>Hedgehogs</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	Was the primary Game Designer who lead the development team to create Hedgehogs! From pitch to release!
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>Goal: I was eager to work on a mechanic that I thought would be helpful to players and fit <em>Two Dot's</em> cute aesthetic. I'm glad that Hedgehogs ended up being a mechanic that both players love to play with and the team loved to make!</b>
